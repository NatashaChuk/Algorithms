1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
	A:  Finding a particular student in a small classroom of students

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
	A:  Locating an employee name in a large alphabetically sorted company directory

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
	A:  7	

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
	A:  3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
	A:  I would choose linear search due to the collection being unsorted. That way the algorithm loops through each item.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
	A:  With the collection being sorted, I would choose binary search as it would be much quicker for the size of the collection.

Programming Assignment:
You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
	A:   var arr = ["Agile", "Albatross", "Base", "Code", "Developer"];

	     function wordSearch(arr, word) {
		var low = arr[0];
		var high = arr[arr.length - 1];

		while (low <= high) {
		  var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2;
		  mid = Math.round(mid);

		  if (arr[mid] > word) {
		   high = arr[mid - 1];
		  
		  } else if (arr[mid] < word) {
		     low = arr[mid + 1];	 
 		  
		  } else {
		      return arr[mid];
		  }

 		}
		return "Word not found";
  	     }

	      console.log(wordSearch(arr, "Albatross"));
	      console.log(wordSearch(arr, "Apple"));
	
You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
	
	A:    var fishTank = ["koi", "sea turtle", "white-spotted goldfish", "baby blue shark", "blue eel"];

	      function findFish(arr, fish) {
                 for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		    value = arr[i];

                    if (value === fish) {
	 		var result = i;
		    }
                 }
		 return result;
              }

	      console.log(findFish(fishTank, "white-spotted goldfish"));
